# Project name -- hospital-manager-system
Hospitals are the essential part of our lives, providing best medical facilities to people suffering from various ailments, 
which may be due to change in climatic conditions, increased work-load, emotional trauma stress etc, it is necessary for the 
hospital to keep track personals that keep the hospital running smoothly & successfully.
But keeping track of all the activities and their records on paper is very cumbersome and error prone. It is very inefficient 
and a time consuming process . Observing the continuous increase in population and number of people visiting the hospital.
 Recoding and maintaining all these records in highly unreliable, inefficint and error-prone. It is also not economically & 
technically feasible to maintain records on paper.Thus keeping the working of the manual system as the basis of our project.
 We have developed an automated version of the manual system, named as "Hospital Manager"
The main aim of our project is to provide a paper-less work up to 90%. 
It is helpfull to provide low-cost reliable automation of the exixting systems.
The system also provides excellent security of data at every level of user-system interaction and also provides robust & reliable
storage and backup facilities.
