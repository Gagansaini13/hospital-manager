			The IT system has revolutionised the field of medicine. In this fast-paced world of medicine, it is a daunting task to manage a multi-speciality hospital. A hospital management system (HMS) is a computer or web based system that facilitates managing the functioning of the hospital or any medical set up. This system or software will help in making the whole functioning paperless. It integrates all the information regarding patients, doctors, staff, hospital administrative details etc. into one software. It has sections for various professionals that make up a hospital.

			About us
		</span>
		<p class="pstyle1">
			Hospitals are the essential part of our lives, providing best medical facilities to people suffering from various ailments, which may be due to change in climatic conditions, increased work-load, emotional trauma stress etc, it is necessary for the hospital to keep track personals that keep the hospital running smoothly & successfully<br><br>
			But keeping track of all the activities and their records on paper is very cumbersome and error prone. It is very inefficient and a time consuming process Observing the continuous increase in population and number of people visiting the hospital. Recoding and maintaining all these records in highly unreliable, inefficint and error-prone. It is also not economically & technically feasible to maintain records on paper.<br><br>
			Thus keeping the working of the manual system as the basis of our project. We have developed an automated version of the manual system, named as "Hospital Manager".<br><br>
			The main aim of our project is to provide a paper-less work up to 90%. It is helpfull to provide low-cost reliable automation of the exixting systems. The system also provides excellent security of data at every level of user-system interaction and also provides robust & reliable storage and backup facilities.
